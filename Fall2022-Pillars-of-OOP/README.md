# Pillars of OOP

--Additional features that explain the why (and how) particular classes can interact with each other within an object-oriented programming language
--Heavily integrated with classes
-- Four! Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation (APIE)
## Encapsulation

-- Being able to bundle loads of variables together under the umbrella of an object
-- The ability to create classes that encapsulate many different variables as properties on object
-- Ability to choose which properties and methods are being displayed to the public
-- Think class creation instantiating!
## Abstraction

-- Ability to 'boil' a class down to its most basic components
-- The act of 'generalizing' a class to be reused as a base for other classes
-- Taking similarities from multiple classes and putting them in a parent class that the others are now derived from
-- There are a few different ways to abstract
-- All squares (children) are rectangles (parents) but not all rectangles are squares
-- Classes, Abstract Classes, Interfaces
## Inheritance

-- The act of taking properties and methods from a parent class or interface and using them as your own
-- The other side of abstractions
-- There are a few different ways to inherit
## Polymorphism
-- The idea that children can act as their parents when needed 
-- Many forms (an object can take on different typings dependent on parent classes and interfaces)
